				For over 70 years, the St. Cloud July 4th Fireworks have lit up the sky to commemorate
				America′s birthday and celebrate our nation′s founding, courtesy of area businesses,
				organizations and individuals and a dedicated group of volunteers.
			</p>
			<p class="py-1">
				The St. Cloud Fireworks Committee is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that works throughout
				the year with contributors, organizing venues and activities, coordinating vendors and
				working with various city and public safety departments to ensure a festive and safe July
				4th event.
			</p>

			<p class="py-1">
				The July 4th Fireworks are organized and sponsored by the St. Cloud Fireworks Committee, an
				all-volunteer group. The Fireworks display is funded entirely by donations and contributions
				from area businesses and individuals.
			</p>

			<p class="py-1">
				The Fourth of July is the quintessential American holiday – St. Cloud has the perfect
				location to celebrate America′s birthday – two beautiful parks along a gorgeous stretch of
				the upper Mississippi river — all day and with a fireworks finale. The Fireworks Committee
				is charged with making sure everything is in place for the generations of families and
				friends that gather and have a great time together each year, and continuing a rich
				tradition we help keep going strong.
			</p>

			<p class="py-1">
				The first July 4th Fireworks displays were launched in St. Cloud at Lake George starting in
				1947 and continued there for several years until they were moved to the Benton County
				Fairgrounds.
			</p>

			<p class="py-1">
				The July 4th Fireworks were moved to Wilson Park to handle the growing crowds and larger
				shells fired to celebrate America′s birthday. As industry guidelines required more safety
				zone distance for spectators, the viewing area in Wilson Park was significantly reduced. The
				launch site was moved on to the Mississippi River in 2006 to provide additional safety and
				more viewing areas for spectators.
			</p>

			<p class="py-1">
				Today, thousands of area residents and visitors spanning multiple generations, come together
				each July 4th along the banks and parks near the Mississippi River to experience the
				History, join the Celebration, and support the Tradition of the birth of the United States
				of America!
