				<br />
				The Honorary Fireworks Commissioner title recognizes area businesses, residents and organizations
				that embrace the importance of America’s Independence Day by helping make possible one of the
				largest July 4th pyrotechnic displays and celebrations in the upper Midwest and by embodying
				the spirit, tradition and significance of America’s founding, and the commitment to continue
				to ensure the ideals of our founding fathers. Honorary Fireworks Commissioners have the honor
				of pushing the button that begins the pyrotechnics on July 4th. They also represent the Fireworks
				Committee by riding on the St. Cloud Fire Department’s antique Ahrens Fox Firetruck in the Granite
				City Days parade in June.
