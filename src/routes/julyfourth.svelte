				On July 4, 2020, the United States will celebrate its 244th birthday. John Adams wrote in
				the momentous year of 1776 that the signing of the Declaration, “…ought to be celebrated by
				pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations from
				one end of this continent to the other…” To the men putting their names to the Declaration
				of Independence – that revolutionary document – nothing was certain. The framers did not
				pledge their “lives, fortunes, and sacred honor,” lightly. They were picking a fight with
				the most powerful empire on earth, in the name of principles that stood in opposition to the
				entire world order of the eighteenth century. Principles they believed applied not only to
				themselves but to all generations, born and unborn.
			</p>
			<p class="py-1">
				Those eternal principles are what makes the Declaration so revolutionary. It is a public
				pronouncement of the American conscience. It is a bold statement that was the culmination of
				years of debate, discussion, protests, and conflict. It is that statement and those
				principles that we celebrate. The principle that all men are created equal, that they are
				endowed by their creator with inalienable rights, and that government derives its just
				powers from the people’s consent.
			</p>

			<p class="py-1">
				And so, as a nation, we celebrate the Fourth of July. A day a public letter was signed with
				great hope for a future where a nation would be founded upon these foundational principles.
				Our great national victory was not a battle or a treaty, but a proclamation of our own
				identity. Our Independence Day is a day that we reflect on the courage of the founding
				generation and the boldness of their, and our, declaration of eternal principles. Our
				Declaration of Independence.

			<p class="py-1">
				Nations come into being in many ways. Military rebellion, civil strife, acts of heroism,
				acts of treachery, a thousand greater and lesser clashes between defenders of the old order
				and supporters of the new–all these occurrences and more have marked the emergences of new
				nations, large and small. The birth of our own nation included them all. That birth was
				unique, not only in the immensity of its later impact on the course of world history and the
				growth of democracy, but also because so many of the threads in our national history run
				back through time to come together in one place, in one time, and in one document: the
				Declaration of Independence.

				> Unlike the other founding documents, the Declaration of Independence is not legally binding,
				but it is powerful. Abraham Lincoln called it “a rebuke and a stumbling-block to tyranny and
				oppression.” It continues to inspire people around the world to fight for freedom and equality.
